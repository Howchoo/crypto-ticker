## Settings

You can customize the application by adding any of the following settings to your settings.env file in the root directory of this repo:


| Name | Default | Description |
|--|--|--|
| SYMBOLS | btc,eth | The asset symbols you want to track. |
| CURRENCY | usd | The currency used to show asset prices. CoinGecko currently supports "usd" and "eur", while CoinMarketCap supports only "usd". |
| API | coingecko | The API you want to use to fetch price data. Currently supported APIs are "coingecko" and "coinmarketcap". |
| REFRESH_RATE | 300 | How often to refresh price data, in seconds. |
| SLEEP | 3 | How long each asset price displays before rotating, in seconds. |
| CMC\_API\_KEY | | The CoinMarketCap API key, required if you specified API=coinmarketcap. |
| SANDBOX | | Used for CoinMarketCap only. Set SANDBOX=false if you're developing and want to use the sandbox API. |

Example:

```
SYMBOLS=btc,eth,ltc,xrp
API=coingecko
```

Note: Some symbols are ambiguous. For example, `uni` currently corresponds to three different currencies in the CoinGecko API. To specify the
currency or token you want (with CoinGecko only), you can use the following:

```
SYMBOLS=btc,eth,uni:uniswap
```

The second value (uniswap) corresponds to the ID of the currency in the API. This is currently only supported for the CoinGecko API. You can
find the CoinGecko ID for a token in the URL. E.g. https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uniswap.
